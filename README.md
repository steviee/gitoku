# Introduction

*gitoku* (name borrowed from git and Hiroku) is a small set of scripts to allow easy provisioning of rails-capable servers and deployment of rails applications via git push command.

Currently vagrant and ssh-based bootstrapping is supported (very experimental, both).

I'm woking on this.


## Roadmap

* allow `Gitokufile` file to configure the rails runtime environment (dependencies, webrick?, thin?, unicorn?, passenger?...).
* enable setting of runtime environment via some mechanism
* enable restarting of server according to `Gitokufile`
